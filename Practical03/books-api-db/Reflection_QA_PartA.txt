-Indicate the query, create a request, & request the query to get a result.

-I understand the usefulness of having a relational database 
but good lord the syntax is quite messy compared to something like Mongoose. 
It did get me to learn how to create my own snippets in vscode though, so yay.

-I did miss out an await while trying to query and the console error was a slight pain to 
figure out since it said that it wasn't connected to the database... Then what is `await sql.connect()` doing???
but yeah.
