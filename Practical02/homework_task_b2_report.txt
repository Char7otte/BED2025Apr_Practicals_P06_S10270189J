app.use(express.json()) is middleware for parsing incoming JSON requests. Middleware are functions that run between a request and a response. 
In the case of the above function, it unwraps JSON data from a request and turns it into a Javascript object for the app to use. 
This function needs to be included, as Express occludes it to be lighter and not all servers need to parse JSON data. 
In the case of food-api, it is to parse the JSON data of the foods object.

req.body is the content sent by the request. In food-api, it contains the data that is to be created or updated.
req.query is for searching/filtering. It is for retrieving the data from the `?name=` part.
req.params.id is to retrieve a specific ID sent in the URL of the request.

GET is to retrieve data from the server. It is the READ of CRUD.
POST is to update something from the server. It is the UPDATE of CRUD.
PUT is to create something new to put on the server. It is the CREATE of CRUD.
DELETE is to delete something on the server. It is the DELETE of CRUD.

200 means that the request succeeded.
201 is for successfully creating something on the server.
400 is for when the request fails due to something that is perceived to be a client error.
404 is when the requested resource cannot be found.
500 is when there is an unexpected error server side.
