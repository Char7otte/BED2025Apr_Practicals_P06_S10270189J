Reflection:
-When sending a response, it should always include a 'return' to ensure that no further code in the method is executed. 
This is especially important in situations where there are loops like if/else.

-Sending a .status() is important for debugging purposes.

-I had previously used Express 4. I hadn't realized that it had updated to Express 5 so debugging the syntax changes 
such as `req.params("id")` -> req.params.id` and `app.get(*)` -> `app.get("/*splat") was enlightening.

Q&A:
A)POST does not need an identifier like :id, so it's more appropriate for creating an object where the server will create an ID. 
PUT does need an identifier, so you can use it to easily find an object to update.

B)404 not found.
